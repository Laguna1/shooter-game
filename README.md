## About the game:
#### The main character 
- is a spaceship commander who patrols his sector of responsibility.
#### The goal 
- is to keep the ship intact during the mission, to pass as few enemies or dangerous objects through your sector as possible. You should avoid approaching, direct contact with the enemy or direct hit by an enemy shot - in this case, the mission is defeated.
#### Available weapon 
- a laser that fires directly in front of you each time you press the "space" key
#### Mobility 
- the ship can move forward, backward, right, left.
#### The enemies 
- a squadron of alien ships and asteroids - can be destroyed by shots.
### How to play
